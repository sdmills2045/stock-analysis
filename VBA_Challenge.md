# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

The basis of this project is to create an easy-to-use workbook to analyze stock returns.

### Purpose

We are refactoring the VBA code so that the macro runs faster and more efficient.

## Results

### Analysis of Refactoring

- What are conclusions you can draw?

The first conclusion is the timer was much faster after refactoring the code. A major reason for this change is a comparison of the code that was provided. The order of my commands caused a delay of almost 7 seconds on the timer. 

The second conclusion is that the code used in refactoring only applies to the array of 12 tickers. If analysis of more than 12 tickers is needed, I don’t think this VBA code would work. 

### Summary of Challenge

This exercise clarified the process of looping. We covered the processes and terminology associated with the process. The disadvantage is that it is sample specific.

The refactored VBA script was much faster than the original script. 

Again, I had an issue with my percentage formats being incorrect. The calculations however seem to be correct.
